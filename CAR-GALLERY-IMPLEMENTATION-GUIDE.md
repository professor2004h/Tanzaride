## 🔧 How It Works

### **Data Flow**

1. **cars-data.js** contains all vehicle information
2. **cars-loader.js** reads the data and creates HTML elements
3. **cars.html** displays the dynamically generated car cards
4. **gallery.js** creates the gallery from the same data
5. **gallery.html** displays all images with lightbox

### **Image Loading**

Images are loaded using relative paths:
```javascript
// Example path
"Copy of TANZA RIDES/SAFARI CARS/TOYOTA LAND CRUISER (SAFARI)/1.jpg"
```

If an image fails to load, it falls back to: `assets/Car.webp`

## 🎯 Auto-Generated Descriptions

Each vehicle has a professionally written description based on its type:

**Examples:**
- **BMW 7 Series**: "Luxurious executive sedan perfect for weddings, corporate events, and VIP transportation..."
- **Toyota Hiace**: "The most popular van for group travel in Tanzania. Extremely reliable with seating for up to 14 passengers..."
- **Land Rover Defender**: "Iconic off-road vehicle perfect for serious safari adventures..."

- 3 columns of car cards
- Full-size filter buttons
- Large lightbox images

### **Tablet (768px - 1199px)**

- Medium lightbox images

### **Mobile (< 768px)**

- Full-width search box
- Touch-friendly lightbox controls

### **Color Scheme**

- White Background: `#ffffff`
- Light Gray: `#f5f5f5`

### **Key Visual Elements**

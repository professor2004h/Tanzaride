## üöÄ NEXT STEPS - CHOOSE YOUR METHOD

### **METHOD 1: Automatic Download (Quick & Easy)** ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

This method uses the PowerShell script to automatically download sample car images from Unsplash.

#### Steps:

1. **Open PowerShell** in the `D:\Tanzaride` directory
   - Right-click in the folder and select "Open in Terminal" or "Open PowerShell window here"

2. **Run the download script:**
   ```powershell
   .\download-car-images.ps1
   ```

3. **Wait for downloads to complete** (about 10-15 seconds)
   - The script will download 9 car images to the `assets` folder
   - You'll see progress messages for each download

4. **Review the downloaded images:**
   - Open the `assets` folder
   - Check each image to see if it matches the car model
   - Images are generic car photos from Unsplash

5. **Replace any images that don't match:**
   - If an image doesn't look right, manually download a better one (see Method 2)
   - Keep the same filename when replacing

6. **Test the website:**
   - Open `index.html` in your browser
   - Navigate to the "Available Vehicles" section
   - Click "View More" to see all 9 cars on `cars.html`
   - Verify all images load correctly

---

### **METHOD 2: Manual Download (Best Quality)** üéØ BEST RESULTS

This method gives you full control to select the perfect image for each car model.

#### Steps:

1. **Open the sourcing guide:**
   - Open `IMAGE-SOURCING-GUIDE.md` in a text editor
   - This guide has direct links to search for each car model

2. **For each of the 9 cars, do the following:**

   **a) Visit Unsplash:**
   - Go to https://unsplash.com
   - Search for the car model (e.g., "Toyota RAV4")
   
   **b) Select an image:**
   - Choose a high-quality, professional photo
   - Prefer images with:
     - Clean, modern vehicles
     - Good lighting
     - Outdoor settings (African context is a bonus)
     - No watermarks
   
   **c) Download the image:**
   - Click the download button (‚Üì)
   - Select "Medium" or "Large" size (not "Original" - too big)
   
   **d) Save to assets folder:**
   - Save the image to `D:\Tanzaride\assets\`
   - Use the exact filename from the list below
   - Format: JPG or WebP

3. **Required filenames (MUST match exactly):**

   honda-crv-2019.jpg
   toyota-hiace-2021.jpg
   nissan-xtrail-2018.jpg
   mazda-cx5-2020.jpg

   mitsubishi-outlander-2021.jpg
   toyota-corolla-2020.jpg
   land-cruiser-prado-2019.jpg
   ```

4. **Optimize images (optional but recommended):**
   - If any image is over 500KB, compress it
   - Use https://tinypng.com or https://squoosh.app
   - Target: 200-400KB per image

5. **Test the website:**
   - Open `index.html` in your browser
   - Check that all images load correctly
   - Verify images look professional and match the car models

### **METHOD 3: Hybrid Approach** üîÑ BALANCED

Combine both methods for the best of both worlds:

1. **Run the PowerShell script** to get all 9 images quickly
2. **Review each image** in the assets folder
3. **Manually replace** any images that don't match or look unprofessional
4. **Keep the same filenames** when replacing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Filename Accuracy:**
   - Filenames MUST match exactly (including hyphens and file extension)
   - Wrong: `Toyota-RAV4-2020.jpg` ‚ùå
   - Correct: `toyota-rav4-2020.jpg` ‚úÖ

4. **Exact Model Match:**
   - Try to find the exact car model when possible
   - If unavailable, use a similar model from the same manufacturer
   - Generic category images (SUV, sedan, van) are acceptable as fallback

5. **Copyright:**
   - Only use images from free stock photo sites
   - Never use images from Google Images without checking license
   - Unsplash, Pexels, and Pixabay are 100% safe for commercial use
